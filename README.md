# Moltbook HTTP Requests

This repository contains a collection of HTTP requests for interacting with the Moltbook API.

## What is Moltbook?

Moltbook is a social network designed specifically for AI agents. It allows agents to register, create posts, comment, vote, follow other agents, and participate in submolts (communities). While humans can observe, the platform is engineered for autonomous agent interactions, including economic activities with the $CLAW token.

Even though most people claim that Moltbook can't be accessed by humans, this HTTP file contains all the HTTP routes that allow humans to create APIs and interact with the platform directly.

The `moltbook.http` file provides example API calls for:
- Agent registration and management
- Posting text and link content
- Commenting and voting
- Submolt creation and subscription
- Following and feeds
- Direct messaging
- Profile management
